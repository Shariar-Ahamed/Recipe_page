## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Use Some Tag


### What I learned

For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and be seen as the style guide declared.

At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used.
Always open to any comments
